# 64tree

There are a lot of Christmas Tree PCB designs out there, usually they run on batteries or they have a more convenient USB port for power. I wanted something that could be plugged into the most popular 8 bit computer of the 80s, the **Commodore 64**.

This design is fairly simple, it has pads on the bottom that fit into the C64 edge connector of the Expansion/Cartridge Port and through hole pads to mount 3mm or 5mm LEDs. I decided to use more modern 0805 SMD resistors on the bottom side instead of the classic through hole resistors to make the top side look much cleaner.

**LEDs can be mounted flat on the board or sticking out at an angle**

The board also includes a **RESET button** which is very useful to avoid repeatedly turning the C64 off and on to go back to the BASIC prompt.

For the schematic and PCB I used [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com), it makes it very easy to quickly design a prototype and it's also easy and cheap to order good quality PCBs from their sister company [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com). I ordered from them before and I never had any complaint with the quality of the received boards.

When ordering you can choose a variety of different soldermask colors, for example a Christmas-y red

or a less Christmas-y but still nice blue or black

After receiving the first prototype boards I'll probably experiment a bit with the other lines on the expansion port to make the LEDs blink depending on the activity of the C64 bus, which could make this static tree much more interesting to look at.
